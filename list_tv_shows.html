        <p>The first TV show I recommend you stream on Netflix is Patriot Act.

The Peabody Award-winning comic explores the modern cultural and political landscape with depth and sincerity. In each weekly episode, he uses his unique comedic voice and storytelling skill to investigate the larger trends shaping the fragmented world. According to Netflix, Minhaj, who also serves as an executive producer, is the first Indian-American host of a weekly comedy show.</p>
