        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>From April 2019 To Now</p>
            <p>Front End Supervisor, Ross</p>
            <p>As a member of the store’s leadership, I am responsible for maintaining the front end, general operations and supervision of the store and help function as the Manager on Duty.

            <p>Seasonal Retail Associate, Marshalls</p>

            <p>Math Tutor, Long Beach City College</p>
            <p>I assisted community college students in their math courses, ranging from basic Arithmetic to Calculus 2. I helped students with any difficult problems they ran into when they were working on coursework and homework in the Multidisciplinary Center. I would specifically have them show me how much they worked on the problem already before I offered my help. I would also have them explain to me step by step the way they attempted the problem, to make it easier for them to understand how to solve the problem once we solved it together. Then I would ask them to solve another problem that had the same concept they just had trouble with to make sure they understood and grasped the concept fully.</p>

            <p>I would assist the instructor by offering community college students more help with their Calculus 1 coursework. I worked in cooperation with the instructor to plan out supplemental instruction sessions, which reviewed content and material discussed in lecture. In these sessions I provided worksheets and practice problems that contained similar concepts that were previously discussed in lecture. I also reviewed difficult concepts students were struggling with, and helped to facilitate group discussion and participation to assist the students feel more comfortable with the subject.</p>
            
            <p>From November 2015 To January 2016</p>
